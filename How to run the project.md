#### 1\. Run the FastAPI backend



Inside your bg\_remover folder, you already have src/api.py. Thatâ€™s your FastAPI entrypoint.



Open a terminal inside your project folder and run:



**uvicorn src.api:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000**

* src.api:app â†’ means inside src/api.py, the variable app = FastAPI().

* --reload â†’ auto-restarts server when you edit code.

* Server will run at ðŸ‘‰ http://127.0.0.1:8000



Test it in browser:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

(You should see FastAPIâ€™s Swagger UI)



#### 2\. Setup your Chrome extension



Youâ€™ll have something like this in extension/:



manifest.json



popup.html



popup.js



icon.png (the one we just made ðŸŽ¨)



Make sure your extension code is sending requests to your backend API (http://127.0.0.1:8000/remove-bg).



#### 3\. Load the extension in Chrome



Open Chrome â†’ Extensions â†’ Manage Extensions



Enable Developer Mode (top right).



Click Load unpacked.



Select your extension/ folder.



Youâ€™ll see your icon appear in the browser.
